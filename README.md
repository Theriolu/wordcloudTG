## How to use
![GUI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9527aea1-5504-484a-b0bb-2f7835c7d035)
### 1. Export chat data
Install the [**Telegram desktop app**](https://desktop.telegram.org/) on your computer.
In the Telegram desktop app, open the chat that you want to make the word cloud of.
Click on the **three-dot** icon at the top and select **‚ÄúExport chat history‚Äù** from the menu.
Drag the slider to set the **maximum size** limit, **uncheck** everything and set the format to **Machine-readable JSON**.

### 2. Launch the program
Depending on your installation method launch the program by either **opening the .exe file**, opening the **.AppImage** or using
```
$ python main.pyw
```
in the program's root directory.

### 3. Generate the word cloud!
This step is pretty intuitive but i'll walk you through anyways.

In the first field you have to select the **result.json** file that you've exported from Telegram.

In the second field you *can* add your own list of [**stop words**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word), for example specific to your language. You can find them [**here**](https://github.com/stopwords-iso/). You can also set a custom resolution for the resulting image. Your stop words will be added to the built-in ones. If you don't want this you can turn this off in the [**advanced settings.**](https://github.com/Theriolu/wordcloudTG#advanced-settings-%EF%B8%8F)

Then you can click on **Go** and the word cloud will be <ins>**saved to the directory where the result.json is stored**</ins> in .PNG format.

Advanced settings let you tweak your word cloud to get a better looking result and add aditional generation options:
  
* **Mask** - Makes the words flow in a custom shape.
  * When using a mask the resulting image will be the same resolution as the mask.
  * Mask can be any color you want, where masked out area shold be **#FFFFFF** white.
* **Mask Color Inheritance** - Makes the words inherit their color from the mask based on their position.
